              Chime is a financial technology company founded on a simple idea:
              everyday banking and payment services should be helpful, easy, and
              free. Our mission is to help our members &ndash; everyday people
              who aren&apos;t well-served by traditional banks &ndash; achieve
              financial peace of mind, together.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
              Now more than ever, people are looking for an alternative to
              fee-based banking that&apos;s aligned with their best interests.
              Chime offers everyday consumers that choice. We helped bring
              features to market that were unavailable to most consumers just a
              few years ago &ndash; including early access to paychecks,
              accounts with no monthly fees, and fee-free overdrafts up to $200.
              We also offer a secured credit card that enables people to safely
              build credit. And with 60,000+ fee-free ATMs nationwide &ndash; a
              larger network than the four biggest U.S. banks combined &ndash;
              Chime members never have to look far to access cash. Millions of
              people trust Chime every day.

              A decade ago, in the wake of the global financial crisis, Chime
              founders Chris Britt and Ryan King saw a traditional banking
              system benefitting from people&apos;s misfortune by charging
              billions of dollars in punitive fees each year. In 2012 they
              founded Chime, determined to build a company that would give
              people more control of their financial lives.

              Chime&apos;s business reflects that commitment. Instead of fees

              other words, we aim to profit with our members, not from them.
